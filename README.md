# VBB public transport data

This is **open GTFS data for the [Berlin Brandenburg public transport service (VBB)](http://www.vbb.de/)**, published as [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) on [the *Berlin Open Data* website](http://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/vbb-fahrplandaten-dezember-2015-bis-dezember-2016).

I do not own this data, it is owned by *VBB Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg GmbH*. VBB claims it is **valid from end of July to December 2016**, although they often break this promise.
